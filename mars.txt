Cold and dry, but everything ids my favorite color
The two moons will be a problem for wolfman.
Also there is no snow or water around - bad for swimming and skiing.
Only the mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity. 
In summary, Mars will be better for the mummy then wolfman.
I am still not sure about Dracula.
